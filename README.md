# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code programming puzzles. Advent of Code is an annual event that offers a series of coding challenges throughout the month of December, leading up to Christmas.

## Structure

The repository is organized by year, with each year having its own directory. Inside each year's directory, you'll find subdirectories for each day of the Advent of Code event. Each day's directory contains the solutions and any related files for that day's challenge.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are provided for educational purposes and personal enjoyment. While I strive for accuracy and efficiency in my solutions, there may be better or alternative approaches that I have not explored.
